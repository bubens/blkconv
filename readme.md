# blkconv
blkconv (for "bulk converter") is a finger to scratch my own itch. It's a script written in BASH that crawles through the current folder-structur, finds and converts Libre-/Openoffice files to PDFs, bundles everything into a ZIP archive and puts it in the current folder.

## Installation
Download the file and copy it into your ~/bin folder.

## Usage:
To convert all Open-/LibreOffice files in `my/folder` and its subfolders:

```bash
~/: cd my/folder
~/my/folder/: blkconv
```
